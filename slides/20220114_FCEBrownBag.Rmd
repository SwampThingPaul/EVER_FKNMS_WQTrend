### Land Acknowledgment
I'm presenting to you from the former lands of the Calusa. The Everglades, as we know it today, have been cared for by innumerable generations of original peoples of the past, whose memory we honor. Today, these lands are cared for by the indigenous sovereignties known as the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Sovereign Miccosukee Seminole Nation. We pay respect to their Elders past, present and future as we learn from this land.

--

### Ecosystem Acknowledgment
We acknowledge the diversity of the ecosystems discussed today, from the iconic Ridge and Slough to seagrass meadows, barrier islands, and reefs. The ecosystems of south Florida are valuable beyond the vast array of ecosystem services it provides.

### Disturbance Legacy - FCE Edition

knitr::include_graphics("./plots/background/Kominoskietal_Fig2.jpg")
```

Subtropical coastal systems are exposed to multiple disturbances operating at many spatiotemporal scales that influence biogeochemistry, including long-term presses (i.e., sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), episodic regional pulses (i.e., hurricanes, droughts, temperature extremes, fires), and localized ecosystem legacies of both presses and pulses (i.e., seagrass die-off, peat collapse).

name: objectives

### Objective

* Compile a robust multi-decadal dataset on total and dissolved nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll-a across a coastal wetland-estuary-marine continuum to evaluate biogeochemical signals of disturbance at an unprecedented landscape scale

### Questions

This study was used to address two specifc questions related to temporal and spatial trends in water quality: 
1. Where is the greatest rate of direction change in biogeochemical constituents? 

2. Do spatial patterns of biogeochemical change and disturbance interact?

### Spatio-Temporal Model description

$$
\begin{align}
  \Large \begin{split}
      \mathrm{E}(y_i) & = \alpha + f_1(\text{WY}_i) + f_2(\text{x}_i, \text{y}_i) + f_3(\text{x}_i, \text{y}_i, \text{WY}_i)
  \end{split}
\end{align}
$$
$\mathrm{E}(y_i)$ = Either TN or TP Annual Geometric Mean

$f_1(\text{WY}_i)$ = Water Year Term

$f_2(\text{x}_i, \text{y}_i)$ = Spatial Term (i.e. Lat/Long)

*** 
--

Effectively, the first two smooths are the main effects of

1. long-term trend,
2. spatial variation

The remaining tensor product is the interaction terms which models how the long-term trend varies spatially

name: conclusion

### What we learned so far...

* Interesting spatial gradients across the greater South Everglades, Florida Bay, West Florida Shelf and Keys system.
  * Combing several large datasets over a long(ish) period of time has provide a holistic system view (some of which "we" hypothesized from "smaller" scale studies)
  * Highlights the attenuation of some nutrients across the system
  * Some systems are more of a BGChem hotspot than others

--

* Year-to-year variation in TN and TP across the study area, at times, correspond with pulse and press events (see GAMs).
  * suggesting a push-pull dynamic between events and spatiotemporal variation in nutrients
